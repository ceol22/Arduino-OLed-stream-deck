# Arduino-OLed-stream-deck

Atmega 32u4 based DIY streamdeck. Made using a 128x64 i2c oled display, a 10k potentiometer, 6 buttons and (in the future) 6 WS2812B leds.
It's a 5 page macro keyboard with 6 buttons which is good for up to 30 macros. The macros are send to the pc by an emulated HID joystick and it can be programmed with Gamepad to keyboard press software (like antimicro for linux).

# Tested on:

- Fedora 29 + Antimicro (available from the fedora repos)
